            <p> Essentially, it is your favourite chicken curry (or vegetable or other protein of choice) buried under a mound of delicately spiced fluffy rice, all made in one pot. The rice is steamed over a low heat so it absorbs the flavours of the curry bubbling away underneath.

                So in a nutshell, it is every curry loving-carb monsters dream come true. It has got my name written all over it!

            <p> Unlike Indian or Thai curry, Japanese curry is more savory than spicy. Its an exemplary comfort food and one of the most-loved home-cooked dishes in Japan.</p>
            Recipe Ingredients: 
            <ul>
                <li> skinless, boneless chicken breast </li>
                <li> 1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
                <li> 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper </li>
                <li> water </li>
                <li> 1 can peas </li>
                <li> 5 new potatoes, halved </li>
                <li> 1 package sliced cremini mushrooms </li>
                <li> 2 medium carrots, chopped </li>
                <li> 1 medium onion, chopped </li>
                <li> 2 cups jasmine rice </li>
            </ul>
            Recipe Steps: 
            <ul>
                <li>Place chicken in a large, deep skillet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper on both sides. Add 1/3 cup water to the pan, cover, and cook over medium heat until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. </li>
                <li>While chicken is cooking, pour 2 cups water into a microwave-safe bowl. Break curry sauce mix into pieces and add to water. Heat in the microwave on high for 3 1/2 minutes; remove and stir until sauce mix has completely dissolved. </li>
                <li>Remove chicken from the skillet. Cut into cubes, return to the skillet, and pour curry sauce over top. Stir in peas, potatoes, mushrooms, carrots, and onion. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes. </li>
                <li>Meanwhile, bring remaining water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. </li>
                <li>Scoop rice into bowls and serve curry on top. </li>
            </ul>
